## Overview


The proposed peer-to-peer energy trading model is designed to provide a simple and scalable architecture for the trading of energy between prosumers (producer and consumer). The model is based on Polygon Matic, a side-chain protocol that leverages the Ethereum Network for security and scalability.

## Functionalities

The proposed model can be broadly divided into two functionalities:

1. Admission of Prosumers: Prosumers are admitted into the network through a multi-signature verification process. 

2. Trading of Energy: Energy trading between producers and consumers is facilitated by a verification process using an escrow account. 

## Comparison with other P2P energy trading models

Most P2P energy trading models are based on either the Ethereum Network (simple architecture, high security, but no scalability) or the Hyperledger based framework (complex architecture, scalability and security). By using a side-chain protocol like Polygon Matic with Ethereum, the proposed model simplifies the architecture and improves performance while ensuring scalability.
