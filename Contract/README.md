# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

yarn hardhat verify --constructor-args deploy/arguments.js 0x7380da0624A8219F54407A45eC14d44d4dc8fDD4 --network mumbai
